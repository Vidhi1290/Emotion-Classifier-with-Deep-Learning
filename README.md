# Emotion Classifier with Deep Learning 🚀

Welcome to the Emotion Classifier project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution for emotion classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to build a model capable of accurately categorizing text samples into three emotion classes: anger, joy, and fear. The provided dataset, "Emotion_classify_Data.csv," forms the basis for training and evaluating our model.
